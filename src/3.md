# Part 3 - creative title part 3

Welcome back to part 3. I hope your CHIP-8 Interpreters are all coming along nicely, and giving you the chance to get to grips with the language nicely. Today we'll take a look at error handling in rust, and also take a look at a few other things that you might have come accross already in more detail.

## Errors (9)

Rust's error handling mechanisms are kind of unique. It draws a lot on functional languages here too, with the `Result<T,E>` type being used to represent possible errors that can reasonably be expected to be handled. Panics are the other error mechanism in rust, and are used for unrecoverable errors that stop execution.

### Panics (9.1)

When something goes very very wrong in your program, and you can't really do anything about it, you panic. Rust has the `panic!()` macro, which prints an error message, unwinds and cleans up the stack, and then exits.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("uh oh");
}
```

See how our error message ends up being printed

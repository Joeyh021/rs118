# Raytracer Solutions

The full solution is available on [Github](LINK HERE !TODO! ). Feel free to browse through the commit history to see the stages of how I built my solution.

## 1: Images

### Task 1.1

`image` is great, this is dead simple if you find the right bits in the documentation. Learning to use Rust docs is an important skill.

```rust, noplayground
use image::{Rgb, RgbImage};
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(256, 256);
    for (_, _, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        *px = Rgb([255, 0, 0]);
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

This should yield you a big red square. Don't forget to include `image` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
image = "0.24.1"
```

### Task 1.2

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let width = 400;
    let height = 400;
    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(256, 256);
    for (i, j, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        let r = i as f64 / (width - 1) as f64;
        let g = j as f64 / (height - 1) as f64;
        let b = 0.25;

        *px = Rgb([r, g, b].map(|c| (c * 255.999) as u8))
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

We scale the range 0-1 from 0-255 by multiplying by 255.999, as the `as` cast from float to int in Rust rounds down. I also increased the size of the image here to show off our nice gradient a bit better. I changed the size of the image here to demonstrate that it should work for images of any size (not just 256x256, and not just square). Try playing around with different image sizes and gradients.

## 2: Vectors

### 2.1

Our `Vec3` struct with all it's methods:

```rust, noplayground
pub struct Vec3 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub z: f64,
}

impl Vec3 {
    pub fn len(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y + self.z * self.z).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn normalise(self) -> Self {
        self / self.len()
    }

    pub fn dot(&self, other: &Self) -> f64 {
        self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y + self.z * other.z
    }

    pub fn cross(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Self {
            x: self.y * other.z - self.z * other.y,
            y: self.z * other.x - self.x * other.z,
            z: self.x * other.y - self.y * other.x,
        }
    }

    pub fn to_rgb(self) -> image::Rgb<u8> {
        image::Rgb(
            [self.x, self.y, self.z].map(|c| (c * 255.999) as u8),
        )
    }

    pub fn map<F>(self, mut f: F) -> Vec3
    where
        F: FnMut(f64) -> f64,
    {
        Vec3 {
            x: f(self.x),
            y: f(self.y),
            z: f(self.z),
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.2

You want the `#[derive]` to look like:

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::{Add, Constructor, Div, Mul, Neg, Sub};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Clone, Copy, Add, Div, Mul, Sub, Neg, Constructor)]
pub struct Vec3 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub z: f64,
}
```

Your two hand-written `Mul` impls:

```rust, noplayground
impl Mul<Vec3> for f64 {
    type Output = Vec3;

    fn mul(self, rhs: Vec3) -> Self::Output {
        rhs.map(|x| x * self)
    }
}

impl Mul for Vec3 {
    type Output = Self;

    fn mul(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        Vec3 {
            x: self.x * rhs.x,
            y: self.y * rhs.y,
            z: self.z * rhs.z,
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3

Your macro should look as shown in the instructions. Don't worry if it was kinda confusing, macros are hard.

## 3: Rays

### 3.1

You should have a new file `ray.rs`, and a `mod ray;` statement in `main.rs`. In `ray.rs`:

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::Constructor;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Clone, Constructor)]
pub struct Ray {
    pub origin: Point,
    pub direction: Vec3,
}

impl Ray {
    pub fn at(&self, t: f64) -> Point {
        self.origin + self.direction * t
    }
}
```

### 3.2

Our updated `main` function, with all the camera and geometry definitions:

```rust, noplayground

fn main() {
    //image
    let aspect_ratio = 16.0 / 9.0;
    let img_width: u32 = 400;
    let img_height = (img_width as f64 / aspect_ratio) as u32;

    //camera and viewport
    let view_height = 2.0;
    let view_width = view_height * aspect_ratio;
    let focal_length = 1.0;

    //geometry
    let origin: Point = v!(0);
    let horizontal: Vec3 = v!(view_width, 0, 0); //horizontal size vector
    let vertical: Vec3 = v!(0, -view_height, 0); //vertical size vector, negated because we start in the top left and move *down* when rendering
    let top_left: Point = origin - horizontal / 2.0 - vertical / 2.0 - v!(0, 0, focal_length); //the position of the top left corner of our imgae

    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(img_width, img_height);

    for (i, j, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        //pixel coordinates as scalars from 0.0 <= t <= 1.0
        let u = i as f64 / (img_width - 1) as f64;
        let v = j as f64 / (img_height - 1) as f64;

        //the direction of the ray
        //start at top left, then go horizontally scaled by u and vertically by v
        let ray_direction: Vec3 = top_left + u * horizontal + v * vertical - origin;

        //save pixel colour to buffer
        *px = ray::colour(&Ray::new(origin, ray_direction)).to_rgb();
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

And the simple green `colour` function, under `ray.rs`:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
   v!(0,1,0)
}
```

### 3.3

Our lerp:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
    let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

    //two colours to blend
    let white: Colour = v!(1);
    let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

    //blend
    blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
}
```

## 4: Spheres

###Â 4.1

The entirety of `object.rs` is shown below. Pay careful attention to the quadratic formula in `hit`.

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::Constructor;

use crate::{ray::Ray, vector::Point};

//a sphere
#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Sphere {
    center: Point,
    radius: f64,
}

//calculate ray-sphere intersection stuff
impl Sphere {
    pub fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray) -> bool {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;
        discriminant >= 0.0
    }
}
```

This is the condition you want to add to your colour function too

```rust, noplayground
if object::Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5).hit(ray) {
    return v!(1, 0, 0);
}

```

### 4.2

Your new parallel `for_each` iterator:

```rust, noplayground
buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() //create the iterator over the buffer
    .par_bridge() // bridge it to a parallel iterator
    .for_each(|(i, j, px)| { //for each item in the iterator, execute this closure
        //loop body is unchanged
    }
```

If you're still really struggling with performance, ask someone to have a look over your code with you and we'll see if theres anything else we can do to speed it up.

## 5: Surface Normals & Multiple Objects

### 5.1

The updated `Sphere::hit()` method:

```rust, noplayground
impl Sphere {
    pub fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray) -> Option<f64> {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;
        if discriminant < 0.0 {
            None
        } else {
            Some((-b - discriminant.sqrt()) / (a * 2.0))
        }
    }
}
```

And `Ray::colour()`:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    //if the sphere and ray return Some(t)
    if let Some(t) = object::Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5).hit(ray) {
        //calculate normal, scale and return it
        let normal = (ray.at(t) - v!(0, 0, -1)).normalise();
        (normal + v!(1)) / 2.0
    } else { //else, same as before
        let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
        let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

        //two colours to blend
        let white: Colour = v!(1);
        let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

        //blend
        blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
    }
}
```

### 5.2

The `Hit` struct:

```rust, noplayground
pub struct Hit {
    pub impact_point: Point,
    pub normal: Vec3,
    pub paramater: f64,
}
```

And the `Object` trait:

```rust, noplayground
// Represents objects within the scene
pub trait Object {
    //determines if an object has been hit by a ray
    //returns the impact point, the surface normal to the impact point, and the solution to the impact equation
    //if there is no intersection, return None
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit>;
}
```

`Sphere` will still now have a hit method, but it will be part of it's `Object` implementation:

```rust, noplayground
impl Object for Sphere {
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit> {
        //calculate intersection
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let d = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;

        if d < 0.0 {
            return None;
        }

        //get the correct root, if one lies in the bounds
        let mut root = (-b - d.sqrt()) / (2.0 * a);
        if !(bounds.0..bounds.1).contains(&root) {
            root = (-b + d.sqrt()) / (2.0 * a);
            if !(bounds.0..bounds.1).contains(&root) {
                return None;
            }
        }

        let impact_point = ray.at(root);
        let normal = (impact_point - self.center) / self.radius;

        Some(Hit {
            impact_point,
            normal,
            paramater: root,
        })
    }
}
```

Sphere is still a sphere, but it's also an object too. Rust makes it really easy for us to build expressive abstractions like this, which we do more of down the line when we start working with different materials too.

### 5.3

Something like this will work:

```rust, noplayground
let impact_point = ray.at(root);
//the normal that is always opposite to the incident ray
let normal = (impact_point - self.center) / self.radius;

//make sure the normals always point outward from the sphere's surface regardless of incident ray direction
//set front_face accordingly
let (normal, front_face) = if ray.direction.dot(&normal) > 0.0 {
    (-normal, false)
} else {
    (normal, true)
};

```

### 5.4

Your `Scene` type and it's `Object` impl. See how we're making nice use of that object trait from earlier?

```rust, noplayground
pub type Scene = Vec<Box<dyn Object + Sync>>;

impl Object for Scene {
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit> {
        self.iter()
            .filter_map(|o| o.hit(ray, bounds)) //filter out the ones that don't intersect
            .min_by(|h1, h2| h1.paramater.partial_cmp(&h2.paramater).unwrap()) //sort by smallest parameter, returning lowest
    }
}
```

Try not to worry about trait objects too much now, there's a lot of complexity associated with them (vtables, object safety) once you start to dig into it. All you need to understand is that `dyn Object + Sync` is a type that implements both `Object` and `Sync`, and we need to `Box` it on the heap because we don't know what those type are at compile time, so we can't reason about how big they are.

### 5.5

Our entire scene is defined like so in `main()`:

```rust, noplayground
//world
let objects: Scene = vec![
    Box::new(Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5)),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(v!(0, -100.5, -1), 100.0)),
];
```

We then pass this to `ray::colour`, which is updated as shown:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(scene: &impl Object, ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    if let Some(hit) = scene.hit(ray, (0.0, f64::INFINITY)) {
        (hit.normal + v!(1)) / 2.0
    } else {
        let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
        let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

        //two colours to blend
        let white: Colour = v!(1);
        let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

        //blend
        blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
    }
}
```

## 6: Antialiasing

### 6.1

Pay careful attention to where the randomness is added here. Note also how the colour is not accumulated into an `RGB` type, but one of our own `Vec3` types, and then converted to rgb at the last stage. The body of the updated rendering loop:

```rust, noplayground
//colour is a vector
let mut colour = v!(0);
for _ in 0..samples {
    //randomness here
    let u = (i as f64 + rand::random::<f64>()) / (img_width - 1) as f64;
    let v = (j as f64 + rand::random::<f64>()) / (img_height - 1) as f64;

    let ray_direction: Vec3 = top_left + u * horizontal + v * vertical - origin;
    colour = colour + ray::colour(&objects, &Ray::new(origin, ray_direction));
}
//save pixel colour to buffer
*px = (colour / (samples as f64)).to_rgb(); //convert to RGB here
```

You could also draw the entire scene 100 times and average those out if you wanted, but it might require a bit more work to implement so this is the easy route.

### 6.2

The camera file should look as follows. We're literally just moving stuff over from main and encapsulating a few bits, that'll come in handy later when we make the camera a bit fancier.

```rust, noplayground
use crate::{ray::Ray, v, Point, Vec3};

pub struct Camera {
    origin: Point,
    top_left: Point,
    horizontal: Vec3,
    vertical: Vec3,
}

impl Camera {
    pub fn default() -> Self {
        let aspect_ratio = 16.0 / 9.0;

        let viewport_height = 2.0;
        let viewport_width = aspect_ratio * viewport_height;
        let focal_length = 1.0;

        let origin: Point = v!(0, 0, 0);
        let horizontal = v!(viewport_width, 0, 0);
        let vertical = v!(0, -viewport_height, 0);
        //the top  left of our image is the origin, -1 away from the camera and up and right by half the height/width
        let top_left: Point = origin - horizontal / 2.0 - vertical / 2.0 - v!(0, 0, focal_length);

        Camera {
            origin,
            top_left,
            horizontal,
            vertical,
        }
    }

    pub fn get_ray(&self, u: f64, v: f64) -> Ray {
        let px_position = self.top_left + u * self.horizontal + v * self.vertical;
        Ray::new(self.origin, px_position - self.origin)
    }
}
```

`main` is also edited to remove all this and add a single call to `camera::Camera::default()` instead. The compiler will tell you which variables are used and unused where and what you can remove from `main`. The render loop should get it's rays from the camera using `Camera::get_ray()`. Calculate `u` and `v` the same as before, but pass them to the camera:

```rust, noplayground
let ray = camera.get_ray(u, v);
colour = colour + ray::colour(&objects, &ray);
```

### 6.3

The Indicatif code added in main:

```rust, noplayground
println!("Rendering Scene...");
    let bar = ProgressBar::new((img_width * img_height) as u64);
    bar.set_style(
        ProgressStyle::default_bar()
            .template(
                "{spinner:.green} [{wide_bar:.green/white}] {percent}% - {elapsed_precise} elapsed {msg}",
            )
            .progress_chars("#>-")
            .on_finish(ProgressFinish::WithMessage("-- Done!".into())),
    );
```

`.progress_with(bar)` is added to the iterator chain just before the `for_each()` call

```rust, noplayground
buffer
    .enumerate_pixels_mut()
    .par_bridge()
    .progress_with(bar)
    .for_each(|(i, j, px)| {...
```

Again, I encourage you to style the progress bar yourself.

## 7: Diffuse Materials

### 7.1 & 7.2

I added my randon unit vector function to the `Vec3` struct, but you can put it wherever you think makes sense.

```rust, noplayground
pub fn rand_unit() -> Self {
    loop {
        //random f64 range 0-1, scale it -1 to 1
        let v = v!(rand::random::<f64>() * 2.0 - 1.0);

        //if the vector lies in the unit sphere
        if v.len() < 1.0 {
            //normalise so it lies *on* the sphere and is a unit vector
            break v.normalise();
        }
    }
}
```

Your updated `ray::colour` function should look as shown

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(scene: &impl Object, ray: &Ray, depth: u8) -> Colour {
    if depth == 0 {
        return v!(0);
    }

    if let Some(hit) = scene.hit(ray, (0.0, f64::INFINITY)) {
        let direction = hit.normal + Vec3::rand_unit();
        let origin = hit.impact_point;
        0.5 * colour(scene, &Ray::new(origin, direction), depth - 1)
    } else {
        //... as before
```

Make sure to update the call site for the function to add the `max_depth` parameter.

### 7.3

I added a call to `map()` in `Vec3::to_rgb()` to take the square root of everything before we do the byte conversion.

```rust, noplayground
pub fn to_rgb(self) -> image::Rgb<u8> {
    image::Rgb(
        [self.x, self.y, self.z]
            .map(|c| c.sqrt())
            .map(|c| (c * 255.999) as u8),
    )
}
```

Image encoding and colours is a much more complex topic than you might expect, so its worth looking into if you're interested.

### 7.4

Just changed the `0.0` to `0.00001` in the call to `Scene::hit` in `ray::colour`:

```rust, noplayground
if let Some(hit) = scene.hit(ray, (0.00001, f64::INFINITY)) { //...
```

## 8: Metal

### 8.1

The entire contents of `material.rs` is shown below:

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::Constructor;

use crate::{
    object::Hit,
    ray::Ray,
    vector::{Colour, Vec3},
};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Reflection {
    pub ray: Ray,
    pub colour_attenuation: Colour,
}

pub trait Material {
    fn scatter(&self, incident_ray: &Ray, hit: &Hit) -> Option<Reflection>;
}

#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Lambertian(Colour);

impl Material for Lambertian {
    fn scatter(&self, _: &Ray, hit: &Hit) -> Option<Reflection> {
        //calculate reflected ray
        let scatter_direction = hit.normal + Vec3::rand_unit();
        let reflected_ray = Ray::new(hit.impact_point, scatter_direction);

        //return it, along with the colour attenuation of it for this material
        Some(Reflection {
            ray: reflected_ray,
            colour_attenuation: self.0,
        })
    }
}
```

### 8.2

The new `Sphere` struct should look as follows, with the bounded generic type variable.

```rust, noplayground
#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Sphere<M: Material> {
    center: Point,
    radius: f64,
    material: M,
}
```

`Hit` should have a new field `pub reflection: Option<Reflection>`, and it should be filled at the bottom of `Sphere::hit`

```rust, noplayground
impl<M: Material> Object for Sphere<M> {
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit> {
        // all the same as before
        //...

        let mut h = Hit {
            impact_point,
            normal,
            paramater: root,
            front_face,
            reflection: None,
        };

        h.reflection = self.material.scatter(ray, &h);
        Some(h)
    }
}
```

`ray::colour` should look like this now too:

```rust, noplayground
ub fn colour(scene: &impl Object, ray: &Ray, depth: u8) -> Colour {
    if depth == 0 {
        return v!(0);
    }

    if let Some(hit) = scene.hit(ray, (0.00001, f64::INFINITY)) {
        if let Some(reflection) = hit.reflection {
            reflection.colour_attenuation * colour(scene, &reflection.ray, depth - 1)
        } else {
            v!(0, 0, 0)
        }
    } else {
        let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
        let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

        //two colours to blend
        let white: Colour = v!(1);
        let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

        //blend
        blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
    }
}
```

Don't forget to update the two spheres in `main`:

```rust, noplayground
let objects: Scene = vec![
    Box::new(Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5, Lambertian::new(v!(0.5)))),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(
        v!(0, -100.5, -1),
        100.0,
        Lambertian::new(v!(0.5)),
    )),
];
```

### 8.3

I added `Vec3::is_zero()`, but you could also add it as a private helper function at the bottom if you wanted, or just inline it. It should like this:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn is_zero(&self) -> bool {
    let tolerance: f64 = 1e-8;
    self.x.abs() < tolerance && self.y.abs() < tolerance && self.z.abs() < tolerance
}
```

This conditional check is then added to `Lambertian::scatter`

```rust, noplayground
if scatter_direction.is_zero() {
    scatter_direction = hit.normal;
}
```

### 8.4

The metal struct and impl should look like this:

```rust, noplayground
#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Metal(Colour);

impl Material for Metal {
    fn scatter(&self, incident_ray: &Ray, hit: &Hit) -> Option<Reflection> {
        //the reflected ray direction
        let reflection = reflect(incident_ray.direction, &hit.normal);

        //the scattered ray
        let scattered = Ray::new(hit.impact_point, reflection);

        if scattered.direction.dot(&hit.normal) > 0.0 {
            Some(Reflection {
                ray: scattered,
                colour_attenuation: self.0,
            })
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

fn reflect(v: Vec3, normal: &Vec3) -> Vec3 {
    v - 2.0 * v.dot(normal) * *normal
}
```

The new `Scene` with four spheres is shown below too. This bit isn't hard, it's just boilerplate with constructors so I wouldn't blame you for copy-pasting this.

```rust, noplayground
let objects: Scene = vec![
    Box::new(Sphere::new(
        //center
        v!(0, 0, -1),
        0.5,
        Lambertian::new(v!(0.7, 0.3, 0.3)),
    )),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(
        //ground
        v!(0, -100.5, -1),
        100.0,
        Lambertian::new(v!(0.8, 0.8, 0.0)),
    )),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(
        //left
        v!(-1.0, 0.0, -1.0),
        0.5,
        Metal::new(v!(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)),
    )),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(
        //right
        v!(1.0, 0.0, -1.0),
        0.5,
        Metal::new(v!(0.8, 0.6, 0.2)),
    )),
];
```

### 8.5

You'll need a new field in `Metal`:

```rust, noplayground
#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Metal {
    colour: Colour,
    fuzz: f64,
}
```

The new reflected ray direction in `Metal::scatter` should look add a small random vector, as shown.

```rust, noplayground
let reflection = reflect(incident_ray.direction, &hit.normal) + self.fuzz * Vec3::rand_unit();
```

## 9: Dielectrics

### 9.1

The `refract` function should look like this:

```rust, noplayground
fn refract(incident: Vec3, normal: &Vec3, ratio: f64) -> Vec3 {
    let cos_theta = -incident.dot(normal);
    let r_out_perp = ratio * (incident + cos_theta * *normal);
    let r_out_par = -(1.0 - r_out_perp.dot(&r_out_perp)).abs().sqrt() * *normal;
    r_out_par + r_out_perp
}
```

### 9.2

`Dielectric` and its `Material` impl:

```rust, noplayground
pub struct Dielectric(f64);

impl Material for Dielectric {
    fn scatter(&self, incident_ray: &Ray, hit: &Hit) -> Option<Reflection> {
        let ratio = if hit.front_face { 1.0 / self.0 } else { self.0 };
        let refracted = refract(incident_ray.direction.normalise(), &hit.normal, ratio);
        let out_ray = Ray::new(hit.impact_point, refracted);
        Some(Reflection {
            ray: out_ray,
            colour_attenuation: v!(1),
        })
    }
}
```

### 9.3

The updated `Dielectric::scatter` method:

```rust, noplayground
fn scatter(&self, incident_ray: &Ray, hit: &Hit) -> Option<Reflection> {
    let ratio = if hit.front_face { 1.0 / self.0 } else { self.0 };
    let unit_direction = incident_ray.direction.normalise();

    let cos_theta = -unit_direction.dot(&hit.normal);
    let sin_theta = (1.0 - cos_theta * cos_theta).sqrt();

    let scatter_direction = if (ratio * sin_theta) > 1.0 {
        reflect(unit_direction, &hit.normal)
    } else {
        refract(unit_direction, &hit.normal, ratio)
    };

    let out_ray = Ray::new(hit.impact_point, scatter_direction);
    Some(Reflection {
        ray: out_ray,
        colour_attenuation: v!(1),
    })
}
```

### 9.4

The reflectance function for the Schlick approximation:

```rust, noplayground
fn reflectance(cos_theta: f64, n: f64) -> f64 {
    let r0 = f64::powi((1.0 - n) / (1.0 + n), 2);
    r0 + (1.0 - r0) * f64::powi(1.0 - cos_theta, 5)
}
```

The `if` expression that binds to `scatter_direction` needs updating to add an extra condition for reflectance:

```rust, noplayground
let scatter_direction = if (ratio * sin_theta > 1.0)
    || reflectance(cos_theta, ratio) > rand::random() {
    //reflect
} else {
    //refract
}
```

# Raytracer Solutions

The full solution is available on [Github](LINK HERE !TODO! ). Feel free to browse through the commit history to see the stages of how I built my solution.

## 1: Images

### Task 1.1

`image` is great, this is dead simple if you find the right bits in the documentation. Learning to use Rust docs is an important skill.

```rust, noplayground
use image::{Rgb, RgbImage};
fn main() {
    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(256, 256);
    for (_, _, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        *px = Rgb([255, 0, 0]);
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

This should yield you a big red square. Don't forget to include `image` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
image = "0.24.1"
```

### Task 1.2

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
    let width = 400;
    let height = 400;
    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(256, 256);
    for (i, j, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        let r = i as f64 / (width - 1) as f64;
        let g = j as f64 / (height - 1) as f64;
        let b = 0.25;

        *px = Rgb([r, g, b].map(|c| (c * 255.999) as u8))
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

We scale the range 0-1 from 0-255 by multiplying by 255.999, as the `as` cast from float to int in Rust rounds down. I also increased the size of the image here to show off our nice gradient a bit better. I changed the size of the image here to demonstrate that it should work for images of any size (not just 256x256, and not just square). Try playing around with different image sizes and gradients.

## 2: Vectors

### 2.1

Our `Vec3` struct with all it's methods:

```rust
pub struct Vec3 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub z: f64,
}

impl Vec3 {
    pub fn len(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y + self.z * self.z).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn normalise(self) -> Self {
        self / self.len()
    }

    pub fn dot(&self, other: &Self) -> f64 {
        self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y + self.z * other.z
    }

    pub fn cross(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Self {
            x: self.y * other.z - self.z * other.y,
            y: self.z * other.x - self.x * other.z,
            z: self.x * other.y - self.y * other.x,
        }
    }

    pub fn to_rgb(self) -> image::Rgb<u8> {
        image::Rgb(
            [self.x, self.y, self.z].map(|c| (c * 255.999) as u8),
        )
    }

    pub fn map<F>(self, mut f: F) -> Vec3
    where
        F: FnMut(f64) -> f64,
    {
        Vec3 {
            x: f(self.x),
            y: f(self.y),
            z: f(self.z),
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.2

You want the `#[derive]` to look like:

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::{Add, Constructor, Div, Mul, Neg, Sub};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Clone, Copy, Add, Div, Mul, Sub, Neg, Constructor)]
pub struct Vec3 {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64,
    pub z: f64,
}
```

Your two hand-written `Mul` impls:

```rust
impl Mul<Vec3> for f64 {
    type Output = Vec3;

    fn mul(self, rhs: Vec3) -> Self::Output {
        rhs.map(|x| x * self)
    }
}

impl Mul for Vec3 {
    type Output = Self;

    fn mul(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        Vec3 {
            x: self.x * rhs.x,
            y: self.y * rhs.y,
            z: self.z * rhs.z,
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3

Your macro should look as shown in the instructions. Don't worry if it was kinda confusing, macros are hard.

## 3: Rays

### 3.1

You should have a new file `ray.rs`, and a `mod ray;` statement in `main.rs`. In `ray.rs`:

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::Constructor;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Clone, Constructor)]
pub struct Ray {
    pub origin: Point,
    pub direction: Vec3,
}

impl Ray {
    pub fn at(&self, t: f64) -> Point {
        self.origin + self.direction * t
    }
}
```

### 3.2

Our updated `main` function, with all the camera and geometry definitions:

```rust, noplayground

fn main() {
    //image
    let aspect_ratio = 16.0 / 9.0;
    let img_width: u32 = 400;
    let img_height = (img_width as f64 / aspect_ratio) as u32;

    //camera and viewport
    let view_height = 2.0;
    let view_width = view_height * aspect_ratio;
    let focal_length = 1.0;

    //geometry
    let origin: Point = v!(0);
    let horizontal: Vec3 = v!(view_width, 0, 0); //horizontal size vector
    let vertical: Vec3 = v!(0, -view_height, 0); //vertical size vector, negated because we start in the top left and move *down* when rendering
    let top_left: Point = origin - horizontal / 2.0 - vertical / 2.0 - v!(0, 0, focal_length); //the position of the top left corner of our imgae

    let mut buffer = RgbImage::new(img_width, img_height);

    for (i, j, px) in buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
        //pixel coordinates as scalars from 0.0 <= t <= 1.0
        let u = i as f64 / (img_width - 1) as f64;
        let v = j as f64 / (img_height - 1) as f64;

        //the direction of the ray
        //start at top left, then go horizontally scaled by u and vertically by v
        let ray_direction: Vec3 = top_left + u * horizontal + v * vertical - origin;

        //save pixel colour to buffer
        *px = ray::colour(&Ray::new(origin, ray_direction)).to_rgb();
    }
    buffer.save("render.png").expect("Could not save image");
}
```

And the simple green `colour` function, under `ray.rs`:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
   v!(0,1,0)
}
```

### 3.3

Our lerp:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
    let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

    //two colours to blend
    let white: Colour = v!(1);
    let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

    //blend
    blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
}
```

## 4: Spheres

###Â 4.1

The entirety of `object.rs` is shown below. Pay careful attention to the quadratic formula in `hit`.

```rust, noplayground
use derive_more::Constructor;

use crate::{ray::Ray, vector::Point};

//a sphere
#[derive(Debug, Constructor)]
pub struct Sphere {
    center: Point,
    radius: f64,
}

//calculate ray-sphere intersection stuff
impl Sphere {
    pub fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray) -> bool {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;
        discriminant >= 0.0
    }
}
```

This is the condition you want to add to your colour function too

```rust, noplayground
if object::Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5).hit(ray) {
    return v!(1, 0, 0);
}

```

### 4.2

Your new parallel `for_each` iterator:

```rust, noplayground
buffer.enumerate_pixels_mut() //create the iterator over the buffer
    .par_bridge() // bridge it to a parallel iterator
    .for_each(|(i, j, px)| { //for each item in the iterator, execute this closure
        //loop body is unchanged
    }
```

If you're still really struggling with performance, ask someone to have a look over your code with you and we'll see if theres anything else we can do to speed it up.

## 5: Surface Normals & Multiple Objects

### 5.1

The updated `Sphere::hit()` method:

```rust, noplayground
impl Sphere {
    pub fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray) -> Option<f64> {
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let discriminant = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;
        if discriminant < 0.0 {
            None
        } else {
            Some((-b - discriminant.sqrt()) / (a * 2.0))
        }
    }
}
```

And `Ray::colour()`:

```rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    //if the sphere and ray return Some(t)
    if let Some(t) = object::Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5).hit(ray) {
        //calculate normal, scale and return it
        let normal = (ray.at(t) - v!(0, 0, -1)).normalise();
        (normal + v!(1)) / 2.0
    } else { //else, same as before
        let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
        let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

        //two colours to blend
        let white: Colour = v!(1);
        let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

        //blend
        blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
    }
}
```

### 5.2

The `Hit` struct:

```rust, noplayground
pub struct Hit {
    pub impact_point: Point,
    pub normal: Vec3,
    pub paramater: f64,
}
```

And the `Object` trait:

```rust, noplayground
// Represents objects within the scene
pub trait Object {
    //determines if an object has been hit by a ray
    //returns the impact point, the surface normal to the impact point, and the solution to the impact equation
    //if there is no intersection, return None
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit>;
}
```

`Sphere` will still now have a hit method, but it will be part of it's `Object` implementation:

```rust, noplayground
impl Object for Sphere {
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit> {
        //calculate intersection
        let oc = ray.origin - self.center;
        let a = ray.direction.dot(&ray.direction);
        let b = 2.0 * oc.dot(&ray.direction);
        let c = oc.dot(&oc) - self.radius * self.radius;
        let d = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;

        if d < 0.0 {
            return None;
        }

        //get the correct root, if one lies in the bounds
        let mut root = (-b - d.sqrt()) / (2.0 * a);
        if !(bounds.0..bounds.1).contains(&root) {
            root = (-b + d.sqrt()) / (2.0 * a);
            if !(bounds.0..bounds.1).contains(&root) {
                return None;
            }
        }

        let impact_point = ray.at(root);
        let normal = (impact_point - self.center) / self.radius;

        Some(Hit {
            impact_point,
            normal,
            paramater: root,
        })
    }
}
```

Sphere is still a sphere, but it's also an object too. Rust makes it really easy for us to build expressive abstractions like this, which we do more of down the line when we start working with different materials too.

### 5.3

Something like this will work:

```rust, noplayground
let impact_point = ray.at(root);
//the normal that is always opposite to the incident ray
let normal = (impact_point - self.center) / self.radius;

//make sure the normals always point outward from the sphere's surface regardless of incident ray direction
//set front_face accordingly
let (normal, front_face) = if ray.direction.dot(&normal) > 0.0 {
    (-normal, false)
} else {
    (normal, true)
};

```

### 5.4

Your `Scene` type and it's `Object` impl. See how we're making nice use of that object trait from earlier?

```rust, noplayground
pub type Scene = Vec<Box<dyn Object + Sync>>;

impl Object for Scene {
    fn hit(&self, ray: &Ray, bounds: (f64, f64)) -> Option<Hit> {
        self.iter()
            .filter_map(|o| o.hit(ray, bounds)) //filter out the ones that don't intersect
            .min_by(|h1, h2| h1.paramater.partial_cmp(&h2.paramater).unwrap()) //sort by smallest parameter, returning lowest
    }
}
```

Try not to worry about trait objects too much now, there's a lot of complexity associated with them (vtables, object safety) once you start to dig into it. All you need to understand is that `dyn Object + Sync` is a type that implements both `Object` and `Sync`, and we need to `Box` it on the heap because we don't know what those type are at compile time, so we can't reason about how big they are.

### 5.5

Our entire scene is defined like so in `main()`:

```rust, noplayground
//world
let objects: Scene = vec![
    Box::new(Sphere::new(v!(0, 0, -1), 0.5)),
    Box::new(Sphere::new(v!(0, -100.5, -1), 100.0)),
];
```

We then pass this to `ray::colour`, which is updated as shown:

````rust, noplayground
pub fn colour(scene: &impl Object, ray: &Ray) -> Colour {
    if let Some(hit) = scene.hit(ray, (0.0, f64::INFINITY)) {
        (hit.normal + v!(1)) / 2.0
    } else {
        let direction = ray.direction.normalise();
        let t = 0.5 * (direction.normalise().y + 1.0); //scale from -1 < y < 1 to  0 < t < 1

        //two colours to blend
        let white: Colour = v!(1);
        let blue: Colour = v!(0.5, 0.7, 1);

        //blend
        blue * t + white * (1.0 - t)
    }
}
```
